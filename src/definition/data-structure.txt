what is an Array?
ans:An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Ans: Array is a fixed length data structure whereas ArrayList is a variable length Collection class.

what is LinkedList?
Ans:The LinkedList class is a collection which can contain many objects of the same type, just like the ArrayList .
The LinkedList class has all of the same methods as the ArrayList class because they both implement the List interface.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
Ans :An array is the data structure that contains a collection of similar type data elements whereas the Linked list is considered as a non-primitive data structure contains a collection of unordered linked elements known as nodes.

what is queue?
Ans: Java Queue is an interface available in java.util package and extends java.util.Collection interface.

what is stack?
Ans: A Stack is a Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure. It supports two basic operations called push and pop.
